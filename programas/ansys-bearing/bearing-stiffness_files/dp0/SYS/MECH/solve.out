 During this loadstep the PCG iterative solver took more than 1000       
 iterations to solve the system of equations.  In the future it may be   
 more efficient to choose a direct solver, such as the SPARSE solver,    
 for this analysis.

 Reading results into the database (SET command) will update the current 
 displacement and force boundary conditions in the database with the     
 values from the results file for that load set.  Note that any          
 subsequent solutions will use these values unless action is taken to    
 either SAVE the current values or not overwrite them (/EXIT,NOSAVE).
