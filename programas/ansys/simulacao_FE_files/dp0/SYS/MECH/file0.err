/COM,ANSYS RELEASE Release 18.1      BUILD 18.1      UP20170403       18:00:11

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.344   TIME= 18:00:17
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.438   TIME= 18:00:17
 Make sure that the rotating element component 1 (component name         
 CM_ROTVE) is axisymmetric about the axis of spin defined by the         
 CMOMEGA command to correctly account for the gyroscopic effect in the   
 stationary reference frame (CORIOLIS, ON,,, ON).                        

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.438   TIME= 18:00:17
 SOLID186 will generate a gyroscopic damping matrix contribution         
 (stationary frame ON on the CORIOLIS command) in a dynamic analysis.    
 The element matrix will be non-symmetric.                               

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.438   TIME= 18:00:17
 BEAM188 will generate a gyroscopic damping matrix contribution          
 (stationary frame ON on the CORIOLIS command) in a dynamic analysis.    
 The element matrix will be non-symmetric.                               

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.672   TIME= 18:00:17
 Material number 7 (used by element 461 ) should normally have at least  
 one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of energy by  
 material may not be available.                                          

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       3.156   TIME= 18:00:26
 There are 1 negative frequencies.  If the corresponding eigenmodes do   
 not correspond to rigid body modes, the downstream QR Damp              
 eigensolution may be incorrect.  Check your model carefully.  If        
 negative frequencies are expected, you may want to double-check the     
 eigensolutions using another eigensolver.                               

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       3.500   TIME= 18:00:29
 Material number 7 (used by element 461 ) should normally have at least  
 one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of energy by  
 material may not be available.                                          

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       3.812   TIME= 18:00:29
 The file0.modesym file does exist and is being used for the QR damp     
 eigensolution since the ReuseKey is set to ON on the QRDOPT command.    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       4.219   TIME= 18:00:30
 Material number 7 (used by element 461 ) should normally have at least  
 one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of energy by  
 material may not be available.                                          

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       4.719   TIME= 18:00:30

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       6.000   TIME= 18:00:33
 Sorting process may not be successful due to the shape of some modes.   
 If results are not satisfactory, try to change the load steps and/or    
 the number of modes.                                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       6.000   TIME= 18:00:33
 At least one of the frequencies is unstable.  Instability check is made 
 on real part of eigenvalue.  If damping is very small, re-running the   
 model using another eigensolver is strongly recommended to              
 double-check the instability prediction.
