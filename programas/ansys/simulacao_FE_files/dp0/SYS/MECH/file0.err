 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.453   TIME= 21:24:16
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.453   TIME= 21:24:16
 Make sure that the rotating element component 1 (component name         
 CM_ROTVE) is axisymmetric about the axis of spin defined by the         
 CMOMEGA command to correctly account for the gyroscopic effect in the   
 stationary reference frame (CORIOLIS, ON,,, ON).                        

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.484   TIME= 21:24:16
 Material number 7 (used by element 1018) should normally have at least  
 one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of energy by  
 material may not be available.

 one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of energy by  
 material may not be available.                                          

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.844   TIME= 21:24:18
 The file0.modesym file does exist and is being used for the QR damp     
 eigensolution since the ReuseKey is set to ON on the QRDOPT command.

 Sorting process may not be successful due to the shape of some modes.   
 If results are not satisfactory, try to change the load steps and/or    
 the number of modes.
